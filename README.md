Diagnosing breast cancer with the kNN algorithm

Routine breast cancer screening allows the disease to be diagnosed and treated
prior to it causing noticeable symptoms. The process of early detection involves
examining the breast tissue for abnormal lumps or masses. If a lump is found, a
fine-needle aspiration biopsy is performed, which utilizes a hollow needle to extract
a small portion of cells from the mass. A clinician then examines the cells under a
microscope to determine whether the mass is likely to be malignant or benign.
If machine learning could automate the identification of cancerous cells, it would
provide considerable benefit to the health system. Automated processes are likely
to improve the efficiency of the detection process, allowing physicians to spend less
time diagnosing and more time treating the disease. An automated screening system
might also provide greater detection accuracy by removing the inherently subjective
human component from the process. We will investigate the utility of machine learning
for detecting cancer by applying the kNN algorithm to measurements of biopsied cells 
from women with abnormal breast masses.


In spite of the fact that kNN is a simple algorithm, it is capable of tackling extremely
complex tasks, such as identifying cancerous masses. In a few simple lines of R
code, we were able to correctly identify whether a mass was malignant or benign 98
percent of the time.
